            <li>1 beef top sirloin steak (1-1/2 pounds), cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, pour boiling water over sun-dried tomatoes; let stand 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet coated with cooking spray, heat butter over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms and shallots until
            tender, 3-4 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from pan.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steaks with pepper and salt. In same skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook steaks until desired doneness
            (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°), 5-7 minutes per side. Remove from pan; keep warm.</li>
