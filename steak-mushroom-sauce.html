            <li>1 beef top sirloin steak (1-1/2 pounds), cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine or reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

            <li>1-1/4 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, pour boiling water over sun-dried tomatoes; let stand 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet coated with cooking spray, heat butter over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms and shallots until
            tender, 3-4 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from pan.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steaks with pepper and salt. In same skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook steaks until desired doneness
            (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°), 5-7 minutes per side. Remove from pan; keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add wine and thyme to skillet; bring to a boil, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Cook, uncovered, until liquid
            is reduced by half. In a bowl, mix flour and broth until smooth; gradually add to wine mixture. Stir in sun-dried
            tomatoes and mushroom mixture; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Spoon over steaks.</li>
